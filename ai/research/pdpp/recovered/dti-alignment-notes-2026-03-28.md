# DTI alignment notes

Moved from the public site (apps/site/content/docs/spec-dti-alignment.md) on 2026-07-07: internal research memo, not protocol documentation.

## DTI's receptiveness to external proposals

- DTI actively solicits external input. CLA-based contribution to DTP codebase. Membership not required.
- Chris Riley led a Brussels working session (early 2024) to gather external input on the third-party trust model.
- 2025 Annual Report: goal is to "be at the table whenever data portability is on the agenda."
- May 2025 blog: "trust is built not on technology alone, but on people and institutions."

## The gap we fill

DTI has publicly acknowledged:
- "Unclear consent processes" in current portability frameworks
- Standard OAuth scopes are too broad for continuous/real-time portability
- EU DMA mandates "continuous and real-time" portability but doesn't specify how third parties should be authorized
- Missing infrastructure for fine-grained, parameterized access controls

No one has proposed parameterized OAuth grants (RFC 9396-based) to DTI for personal data portability. The same standards pattern — OAuth for authorization, plus a domain-specific `authorization_details` type with a domain data and consent model — already underlies Open Banking (FAPI / FDX) for financial data and SMART on FHIR for health data. PDPP applies that pattern to general personal data: it defines what `authorization_details` mean for personal data (data categories, field selection, time ranges, resources, grants, record format, and enforcement rules), so independent clients and resource servers can interoperate without each platform inventing its own consent vocabulary.

## What resonates with DTI

1. Solving the DMA "continuous and real-time" mandate with scoped, ongoing grants
2. Trust and harm mitigation: parameterized grants prevent over-sharing
3. User empowerment through explicit, understandable consent
4. Grounded in standard web protocols (OAuth, RFC 9396)

## What to avoid

Chris Riley explicitly criticized "short-lived dreams of 'trustless' technology, powered by blockchains and math." Keep the proposal grounded in institutional trust, not cryptographic trustlessness. Vana's blockchain/Web3 aspects should not be the lead framing for DTI engagement.

## Path to engagement

DTI is an independent 501(c)(4) nonprofit (not Linux Foundation). Path is direct engagement:
1. Build the spec and working implementation
2. Publish openly
3. Engage Chris Riley / DTI team directly
4. Propose as a contribution to the DTP ecosystem for fine-grained consent

## Spec implications

The standards-pattern framing (use OAuth for authorization, define a domain `authorization_details` type, define the domain data and consent model) is the right framing for DTI. The spec should:
- Use RFC 9396 as the envelope (standard web protocol, not custom)
- Define the grant as a portable consent artifact that any server can enforce
- Be explicit that disclosure constraints are protocol-enforced while fields like purpose and retention are machine-readable policy declarations, not generic downstream-use enforcement
- Define data collection in a separate companion spec (the PDPP Collection Profile), not in core, so the consent/disclosure layer remains agnostic to whether data arrived via connector-driven collection, regulatory export, manual import, or platform-native APIs
- Normatively define the resource server interface for serving records under grant enforcement (core §8), while leaving downstream use of returned records out of scope (like OAuth does not define what an app does with retrieved data)
- Frame `continuous` grants as the answer to DMA's real-time portability requirement
